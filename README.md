# Learn-Hub Central

A multi-page educational web platform designed to centralize essential online learning resources into a clean, organized, and user-friendly interface.  

The rapid expansion of online learning platforms has made it increasingly difficult for learners to efficiently find suitable courses, as resources are scattered across multiple websites such as Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube. This project consolidates those resources into one cohesive site — featuring responsive design, structured learning paths, and a seamless user experience.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The platform provides:

- A **Home** page  
- A **Courses** page (listing available courses/resources)  
- A **Roadmaps** page (structured learning paths across various fields, guiding beginners through progressive steps)  
- A **Contact** page  
- Responsive navigation (desktop + mobile) — including a modern menu bar and “CSS card layout” for previews  
- Smooth user experience with intuitive DOM manipulation and client-side navigation, built using modern front-end tools  

Roadmaps help reduce confusion, save time, and enhance the overall learning experience for users navigating the vast online education ecosystem.
